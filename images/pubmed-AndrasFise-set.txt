TI  - INTERCAAT: identifying interface residues between macromolecules.
LID - btab596 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btab596 [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY: The Interface Contact definition with Adaptable Atom Types (INTERCAAT) was 
      developed to determine the atomic interactions between molecules that form a known 
      three dimensional structure. First, INTERCAAT creates a Voronoi tessellation where 
      each atom acts as a seed. Interactions are defined by atoms that share a hyperplane 
      and whose distance is less than the sum of each atoms' Van der Waals radii plus the 
      diameter of a solvent molecule. Interacting atoms are then classified and 
      interactions are filtered based on compatibility. INTERCAAT implements an adaptive 
      atom classification method; therefore, it can explore interfaces between a variety 
      macromolecules. AVAILABILITY: Source code is freely available at

      Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

TI  - miRNA-mediated loss of m6A increases nascent translation in glioblastoma.
PG  - e1009086

LID - e1009086
AB  - Within the glioblastoma cellular niche, glioma stem cells (GSCs) can give rise to 
      differentiated glioma cells (DGCs) and, when necessary, DGCs can reciprocally give 
      rise to GSCs to maintain the cellular equilibrium necessary for optimal tumor 
      growth. Here, using ribosome profiling, transcriptome and m6A RNA sequencing, we 
      show that GSCs from patients with different subtypes of glioblastoma share a set of 
      transcripts, which exhibit a pattern of m6A loss and increased protein translation 
      during differentiation. The target sequences of a group of miRNAs overlap the 
      canonical RRACH m6A motifs of these transcripts, many of which confer a survival 
      advantage in glioblastoma. Ectopic expression of the RRACH-binding miR-145 induces 
      loss of m6A, formation of FTO/AGO1/ILF3/miR-145 complexes on a clinically relevant 
      tumor suppressor gene (CLIP3) and significant increase in its nascent translation. 
      Inhibition of miR-145 maintains RRACH m6A levels of CLIP3 and inhibits its nascent 
      translation. This study highlights a critical role of miRNAs in assembling complexes 
      for m6A demethylation and induction of protein translation during GSC state 
      transition.

AB  - This review focuses on pharmacophore approaches in researching protein interfaces 
      that bind protein ligands. Pharmacophore descriptions of binding interfaces that 
      employ molecular dynamics simulation can account for effects of solvation and 
      conformational flexibility. In addition, these calculations provide an approximation 
      to entropic considerations and as such, a better approximation of the free energy of 
      binding. Residue-based pharmacophore approaches can facilitate a variety of drug 
      discovery tasks such as the identification of receptor-ligand partners, identifying 
      their binding poses, designing protein interfaces for selectivity, or defining a 
      reduced mutational combinatorial exploration for subsequent experimental engineering 
      techniques by orders of magnitudes.

TI  - Estimating the accuracy of pharmacophore-based detection of cognate receptor-ligand 
      pairs in the immunoglobulin superfamily.
PG  - 632-638
LID - 10.1002/prot.26046 [doi]
AB  - Secreted and membrane-bound members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) 
      encompass a large, diverse array of proteins that play central roles in immune 
      response and neural development, and are implicated in diseases ranging from cancer 
      to rheumatoid arthritis. Despite the potential biomedical benefits of understanding 
      IgSF:IgSF cognate receptor-ligand interactions, relatively little about them is 
      known at a molecular level, and experimentally probing all possible receptor-ligand 
      pairs is prohibitively costly. The Protein Ligand Interface Design (ProtLID) 
      algorithm is a computational pharmacophore-based approach to identify cognate 
      receptor-ligand pairs that was recently validated in a pilot study on a small set of 
      IgSF complexes. Although ProtLID has shown a success rate of 61% at identifying at 
      least one cognate ligand for a given receptor, it currently lacks any form of 
      confidence measure that can prioritize individual receptor-ligand predictions to 
      pursue experimentally. In this study, we expanded the application of ProtLID to 
      cover all IgSF complexes with available structural data. In addition, we introduced 
      an approach to estimate the confidence of predictions made by ProtLID based on a 
      statistical analysis of how the ProtLID-constructed pharmacophore matches the 
      structures of candidate ligands. The confidence score combines the physicochemical 
      compatibility, spatial consistency, and mathematical skewness of the distribution of 
      matches throughout a set of candidate ligands. Our results suggest that a subset of 
      cases meeting stringent confidence criteria will always have at least one successful 
      receptor-ligand prediction.

TI  - A proton-coupled folate transporter mutation causing hereditary folate malabsorption 
      locks the protein in an inward-open conformation.

AB  - The proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT, SLC46A1) is required for folate 
      intestinal absorption and transport across the choroid plexus. Recent work has 
      identified a F392V mutation causing hereditary folate malabsorption. However, the 
      residue properties responsible for this loss of function remains unknown. Using 
      site-directed mutagenesis, we observed complete loss of function with charged (Lys, 
      Asp, and Glu) and polar (Thr, Ser, and Gln) Phe-392 substitutions and minimal 
      function with some neutral substitutions; however, F392M retained full function. 
      Using the substituted-cysteine accessibility method (with N-biotinyl aminoethyl 
      methanethiosulfonate labeling), Phe-392 mutations causing loss of function, although 
      preserving membrane expression and trafficking, also resulted in loss of 
      accessibility of the substituted cysteine in P314C-PCFT located within the aqueous 
      translocation pathway. F392V function and accessibility of the P314C cysteine were 
      restored by insertion of a G305L (suppressor) mutation. A S196L mutation localized 
      in proximity to Gly-305 by homology modeling was inactive. However, when inserted 
      into the inactive F392V scaffold, function was restored (mutually compensatory 
      mutations), as was accessibility of the P314C cysteine residue. Reduced function, 
      documented with F392H PCFT, was due to a 15-fold decrease in methotrexate influx V 
      (max), accompanied by a decreased influx K(t) (4.5-fold) and K(i) (3-fold). The data 
      indicate that Phe-392 is required for rapid oscillation of the carrier among its 
      conformational states and suggest that this is achieved by dampening affinity of the 
      protein for its folate substrates. F392V and other inactivating Phe-392 PCFT 
      mutations lock the protein in its inward-open conformation. Reach (length) and 
      hydrophobicity of Phe-392 appear to be features required for full activity.

AB  - Herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) regulates positive and negative signals for 
      T cell activation through co-signaling pathways. Dysfunction of the HVEM 
      co-signaling network is associated with multiple pathologies related to 
      autoimmunity, infectious disease, and cancer, making the associated molecules 
      biologically and therapeutically attractive targets. HVEM interacts with three 
      ligands from two different superfamilies using two different binding interfaces. The 
      engagement with ligands CD160 and B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), members of 
      immunoglobulin superfamily, is associated with inhibitory signals, whereas 
      inflammatory responses are regulated through the interaction with LIGHT from the TNF 
      superfamily. We computationally redesigned the HVEM recognition interfaces using a 
      residue-specific pharmacophore approach, ProtLID, to achieve switchable-binding 
      specificity. In subsequent cell-based binding assays the new interfaces, designed 
      with only single or double mutations, exhibited selective binding to only one or two 
      out of the three cognate ligands.

TI  - Assessing the accuracy of contact predictions in CASP13.
PG  - 1058-1068
LID - 10.1002/prot.25819 [doi]
AB  - The accuracy of sequence-based tertiary contact predictions was assessed in a blind 
      prediction experiment at the CASP13 meeting. After 4 years of significant 
      improvements in prediction accuracy, another dramatic advance has taken place since 
      CASP12 was held 2 years ago. The precision of predicting the top L/5 contacts in the 
      free modeling category, where L is the corresponding length of the protein in 
      residues, has exceeded 70%. As a comparison, the best-performing group at CASP12 
      with a 47% precision would have finished below the top 1/3 of the CASP13 groups. 
      Extensively trained deep neural network approaches dominate the top performing 
      algorithms, which appear to efficiently integrate information on coevolving residues 
      and interacting fragments or possibly utilize memories of sequence similarities and 
      sometimes can deliver accurate results even in the absence of virtually any target 
      specific evolutionary information. If the current performance is evaluated by 
      F-score on L contacts, it stands around 24% right now, which, despite the tremendous 
      impact and advance in improving its utility for structure modeling, also suggests 
      that there is much room left for further improvement.

AB  - With the advance of experimental procedures obtaining chemical crosslinking 
      information is becoming a fast and routine practice. Information on crosslinks can 
      greatly enhance the accuracy of protein structure modeling. Here, we review the 
      current state of the art in modeling protein structures with the assistance of 
      experimentally determined chemical crosslinks within the framework of the 13th 
      meeting of Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction approaches. This 
      largest-to-date blind assessment reveals benefits of using data assistance in 
      difficult to model protein structure prediction cases. However, in a broader 
      context, it also suggests that with the unprecedented advance in accuracy to predict 
      contacts in recent years, experimental crosslinks will be useful only if their 
      specificity and accuracy further improved and they are better integrated into 
      computational workflows.
